## 🧠 About Me

I see robotics as both a science and an art—where engineering meets creative problem-solving. With over two years of experience deploying 50+ robots across $25M+ installations, I specialize in solutions that launch fast, scale efficiently, and adapt to real-world constraints.

Through ongoing personal projects, I explore advanced robotics applications including humanoid systems, assistive technology, and human-robot interaction. Projects like **C.O.R.I.** and *Software Patch* represent my continued learning and technical curiosity outside of professional work.

When I'm not building, I'm boxing, weightlifting, or reading comics.
