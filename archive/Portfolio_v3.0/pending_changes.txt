On mobile, when using the hamburger menu/nav bar... clicking the link should land in the proper locations... hovering just before the start of that section
I need to fix the way the Featured section "overly zooms in" blowing the page up to be too large to see the other titles
Nav on mobile isn't awesome... how do we fix it...
