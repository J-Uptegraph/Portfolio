🛠️ JUptegraph.dev – Full Portfolio Site To-Do List
Based on UX, robotics hiring, and performance audit – May 2025

✅ CRITICAL – Must Fix Immediately
 Fix Broken Nav Links
    → Make "Portfolio" and "Skills" clickable or remove them.

 Fix/Remove “View Project” Button
    → If it doesn’t open anything, disable it or connect it to a working modal/page.

 Add Intro at Top of Page
    → Add hero text: "Hi, I’m Johnathan – Robotics R&D Engineer focused on adaptive systems."

🔥 HIGH PRIORITY – Strongly Recommended
 Embed Media in Projects
    → Add short videos, CAD screenshots, or annotated diagrams.

 Curate the Skills Section
    → Highlight core robotics/mechatronics, collapse less-relevant tools (e.g., Canva).

 Strengthen Visual Branding
    → Add a simple logo, pick an accent color, and update font hierarchy.

 Fix Mobile Nav Visibility
    → Ensure hamburger icon is visible and opens cleanly. Check tap spacing.

🛠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY – Improvements That Add Depth
 Accessibility Enhancements
    → Add aria-labels to social icons and theme toggle. Add proper form labels.

 Improve SEO Metadata
    → Add unique <title>, OpenGraph tags, and meta descriptions.

 Create Deeper Project Pages (Optional)
    → Add individual modals or pages with expanded details and technical context.

🧹 LOW PRIORITY – Polish & Nice-to-Haves
 Dark Mode Persistence
    → Store user preference using localStorage.

 Add Section Separators or Visual Flow Enhancers
    → Horizontal rules, gradient bands, or soft background changes.

 Skill Descriptions or Microcopy
    → Add real-world usage lines under major skill categories.

 Optional Testimonials
    → Add 1–2 short quotes from leads or coworkers (with permission).

 Alt Text Cleanup
    → Remove "Image:" from all alt tags. Keep it descriptive only.

🔁 LONG-TERM / ONGOING IDEAS
 Write Blog Posts or Case Studies
    → Share a control strategy, ROS project, or field integration story.

 Keep Project Section Updated
    → Add one new project every few months.

 Conduct Real-User Testing
    → Get honest feedback from recruiters or engineers.

 (Optional) Add Personal Video Intro
    → 30-sec “why robotics matters to me” intro builds connection.
